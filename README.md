# test-workspaces
Simple repo to experiment with the combination of git modules and yarn workspaces

Try it:
- Init the repo with
`git clone https://github.com/wonderbeel/test-workspaces.git --recursive`
- Install all the workspaces dependencies with
`yarn install`
- Try to run a command inside a workspace with
`yarn workspace <workspace-name> <command>`
or just try one of the scripts declared in `package.json` :)
